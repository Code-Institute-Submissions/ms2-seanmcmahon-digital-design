## Project Overview

SM Digital Design is a website for a digital designer offering services such as artistic rendering and 3D models (primarily for the construction industry) as well as digital portraits and furniture design.

## UX

The expectation for users is that they be able to sample the work of the digital designer. They can orbit around 3d moddles as well as explore galleries of various services. A landing page gives an overview of the services on offer. Each design discipline has it's own page where a user can see relevant projects and learn more about the processes involved. A contact page allows allows the user to enquire about the work and engage with the designer in order to collaborate.

### User Stories

_- User Story A: Joe is an architect and would like to like to commission renders of a project he is working on to assist with a planning application._
_- User Story B: Joe would also like to commission a 3D model of a project to demonstrate his ideas to a client._
_- User Story C: Liz is interested in commissioning some modern furniture for her living room._
_- User Story D: Hazel would like to commission a digital portrait as an anniversary present._

### Design

A standard layout is fully responsive on mobile devices and larger screens.

#### Libraries

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - is a framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites. I primarily used bootstrap to format layouts and for certain components such as image carousels and buttons.

#### Color Scheme

Colours are kept to a bare minimum, using only the colors for bootstrap bg-light, bg-dark and one green. My palette is located on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/d8be25-00bfff-48c074-ff8596-b36e2f-212121-fffff0)

#### Typography

3 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used across the site:

- [Lily Script One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lily+Script+One?query=lily) : Logo
- [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quicksan) : Headings
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montse) : Body

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq and figma to create the wireframes.

## Testing

### Validators

1. **HTML** [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Used to identify HTML errors

2. **CSS** [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Used to identify CSS errors

### Manual Testing

1. **amiresponsive** [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) Used to test responsiveness across a range of devices.

2. **Developer Tools** Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge web dev tools using iPhone 5 and Ipad as toggle devices to test responsiveness.

3. **Mobile Devices** I used my Google Pixel 3a phone and Amazon Fire tablet to test the site, using this method I found that not all of the fonts were loaded properly originally.

4. **Friends and family** I asked for feedback from friends and family in order to get a users perspective.

5. **Contact Form** On the contact page the form may not be submitted without using correct syntax for the e-mail input or if either input is blank. Once inputs are filled properly the sign up button will lead to a form dump page.

## Deployment

1. I Created a Github account at https://github.com
   My account url; https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon

2. I installed Git and set up a username and password.

3. I created a repository on Github (#)

4. On VS Code I opened the command pallette and selected Git Clone, I pasted in the URL for the repo on GitHub and selected a folder on my computer to sync to.

5. I uploaded all files to my Github repository.

6. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it. Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/ms2-seanmcmahon-digital-design

7. To run this code on a local machine, you would go to my respository at
   https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/ and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
   "Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
   To continue with cloning, you would;

- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/ Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
